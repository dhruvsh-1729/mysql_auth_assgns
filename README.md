# mysql_auth_assgns

Here,I have implemented basic jwt authentication in expressjs with the json data from req object but storing the data in a table named users in the relational database named userdb using MySQL.
We are using Sequelize as an ORM tool between MySQL and ExpressJS like Mongoose for MongoDB.
